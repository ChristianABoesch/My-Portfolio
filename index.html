                    <h3>Audio Production</h3>
                    <p>I love all things related to sound and music. I've done sound design for a group Capstone project as well as a VR/XR experience or two. Every now and then I'll do field recordings on my phone whenever interesting sounds come about. I spend some of my free time dabbling in music production and composition, often sampling found sounds and getting creative with plug-ins.</p>

                    <h3>Video Editing</h3>
                    <p>I've been a huge fan of video editing since I was a kid, but got back into it recently to create colorful and immersive visualizers. I also have experience with vlog-style editing, complete with jump-cuts, background music, and on-screen text. My most recent intrigue is editing for sketch comedy, which I hope to improve on in the future.</p>

                    <h3>Web Design</h3>
                    <p>My years of experience in web design is my reason for making this website. I've tackled Javascript, HTML, and CSS (plus a few others I'm less familiar with) and have designed web pages about everything from my original creative work to a tier list for rocks. I always felt that it would come in handy and now look where it got me!</p>

                    <h3>3-D Modeling?</h3>
                    <p>This one's a maybe. I have experience with Blender and have managed to create and animate some pretty interesting things, but I think I just barely passed my Intro to Modeling class with ASU so I may not be that good. If you're desperate though, I might be able to help.</p>

               <p>As a little kid, I always made noises. Now, as an adult, I love hearing the noises around me. I like to work exclusively with noises and constantly expand my own sound palette. At a very young age I learned that music is just a bunch of noises all put together that actually sound good and are fun to listen to. I started playing piano at age 4 and decided that was just gonna be my life. My interest in music led to me eventually getting accepted to Berklee for a degree in music production and sound design 13 years later. I recently graduated with a follow-up degree at ASU in Digital Media with a focus in music. Now that I'm all done, my next priority is this portfolio website. Gotta make it perfect because it's all I have left.</p>
               <p>I've lived in AZ for 5 years, but before that I lived halfway across the world in Singapore for 13. Before that, I spent my first 5 years of life in Texas, where I was born. I have two parents, one mother and one father. As far as siblings go, I have a younger sister and that's it. It was during my time in Singapore when I started getting into all but one of the skills listed above, but they had always been hobbies, so now I'm working to turn them into a way to make moneh. I'm a firm believer that life-long hobbies give you all the time and experience you need to feel like you could probably make a living with it. And that's exactly why I'm here.</p>
